This is a solo frontend project where I build a simple food ordering application with html, css and javascript.

No external libraries or frameworks are used.

This was the base design provided by Scrimba: https://www.figma.com/file/Hdgwo69Dym9vVsxbuPbl0h/Mobile-Restaurant-Menu?node-id=0%3A1

However, I didn't like it much and I decided to refactor it completely. I haven't used figma for the new design, all of it is made from scratch, directly in CSS.

## Known Issues

- Action icons behavior is buggy.
- Remove action buttons are too big.
- Placeholder & Text color of the form is not visible.
- The app container padding is too much.
